Alias for `!bag view` when used without a subcommand

Bags! Make 'em, view 'em, toss 'em, swap 'em, name 'em, move 'em stuff 'em, dump 'em, fill 'em, weigh 'em, ignore 'em, track 'em!

If you are a homebrew race that has powerful build as a feature, or a similar effect that doubles your carry weight, put your race name in a cvar as such: `!cvar powerfulBuildRaces ["race name"]`

**Inexact Matches**
Some items may be marked with an asterisk. These items have been given the weight of the closest match found, but if you have too many like this, the alias will stop trying because too many loops are bad mmkay. Make sure everything is spelled correctly according to the Player's Handbook or enter custom item weights using `!bag weight <item> <weight>`. Use the **full** names of items for best results.
