Changes how long names are displayed. (Aliases: `l`, `:`)

**Options**
`truncate`: cuts off names if they're too long
`newrow`: gives the bag with a long name its own row if any names are too long (disables `inline`) 
`newline`: does nothing special, just lets the item name overflow into a new line

Usage: `!bag limiter truncate|newrow|newline`
